## Improvemets & Roadmap

### Scalability and performance considerations:

The current implementation has some potential scalability issues:

- The API relies on a single OpenAI request per incoming request, which could become a bottleneck under high load.
- There's no caching mechanism, so identical requests will be processed from scratch each time.

To improve scalability and performance:

- [ ] Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store results for frequently requested data transformations.
- [ ] Consider implementing a queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to handle requests asynchronously, especially for large datasets.
- [ ] Use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple instances of the API.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

### Handling different types of unstructured data:

The current implementation seems to handle unstructured data as a string. To improve handling of various data types:

- [ ] Implement pre-processing steps for common data formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON).
- [ ] Add support for file uploads to handle documents, images with OCR, etc.
- [ ] Enhance the AI prompt to include information about the input data type.
- [ ] Create specialized handlers for specific data types (e.g., a separate module for parsing and structuring email data).

### Security considerations:

Some security aspects to consider:

- [ ] Input validation: Ensure that all input is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] Rate limiting: Implement to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
- [ ] Authentication and authorization: Add a robust auth system to control access to the API.
- [ ] Implement CORS policies to control which domains can access your API.

### Error handling and edge cases:

The current implementation has a basic retry mechanism, but there's room for improvement:

- [ ] Implement more granular error types and handling (e.g., distinguish between AI service errors, parsing errors, and validation errors).
- [ ] Add logging for better debugging and monitoring.
- [ ] Handle timeout scenarios for long-running requests.
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external service calls to fail fast when services are down.
- [ ] Add input size limits and handle oversized requests gracefully.

Potential improvements or extensions to the API:

- Support for batch processing of multiple data items in a single request.
- Implement a feedback mechanism where users can report incorrect transformations to improve the AI model over time.
- Add an endpoint for users to provide their own examples for few-shot learning.
- Implement a streaming API for real-time data transformation.
- Add support for custom AI models or allow users to choose between different models.
